This project consists of:
- Korean to English gaming terms 
- wstring to understand the korean input
- Input can be either in English or Korean
- Partial searches to search if you don't know the entire word

This is made for *LEAGUE OF LEGENDS*, *Valorant*, but also involves generic terms that could be used across other games.

1) WString:
- This project needs wstring as reading and writing Korean terms using string returns gibberish as compiler does not understand

2) Custom Glossary:
- The epsorts terms have been picked from internet or terms I learned while watching the game on Korean Broadcast.
- Some league terminolgy maybe incorrect, but valorant terminology is correct as I have worked for Valorant Korean<->English translation
- A raw data file of all the terms, for example the included data file is in a sequencse of "English | Korean | Category | Defination | Pronounciation |"

3) Pictures:
- Some screenshots are attached to demonstarte how the search works.

4) CLI client:
- This project does not have a proper UI, works only on terminal for now.
- I do have plans on developing a front end for this but not in the near future.
